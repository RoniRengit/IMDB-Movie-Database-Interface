An interface to check out all movie/serial information. You can search by movie name and year. You can get a hell lot of information
such as language, release date, genre, actors, director, writer, imdn rating, rotten tomatoes rating, etc. You can also download
the poster of the movie.I have done error checking but if I have missed something, do let me know.
